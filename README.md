# LAF
#  This is the code supplied with the manuscript titled
#  "Fusion of orthogonal MRI scans into isotropic images using
#  linear algebraic approach" as a demonstration of the method
#  
#  It uses (supplied also) three orthogonal projection images
#  AXL, COR, and SAG (raw format 180 x 180 x 60 voxels, 32-bit 
#  float) of the same subject (kiwi fruit) to fuse them into high
#  resolution isotropic image LAF (raw format 180 x 180 x 180 
#  voxels, 32 bit float). 
#  Names of the files could be changed at the user discretion in
#  the code below.
#  
#  This code requires numpy library
